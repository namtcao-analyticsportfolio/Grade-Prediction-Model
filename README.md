# Grade Conversion & Prediction Model

## Overview
Linear regression model that predicts student grades and converts between two grading systems using statistical analysis two education systems. Case study is German and Polish.

## Business Problem
Educational institutions need reliable methods to compare and predict academic performance across different grading systems for international student admissions and transfers.

## Technical Approach
- **Data Processing**: Cleaned and normalized grade data from both systems
- **Modeling**: Implemented linear regression using scikit-learn
- **Validation**: Achieved 85%+ prediction accuracy through cross-validation
- **Visualization**: Created scatter plots and trendlines showing grade correlations

## Tech Stack
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Statistical analysis and regression modeling

## Key Results
- Successfully mapped grade conversions with statistical confidence
- Model can predict grades with margin of error under 0.3 grade points
- Identified non-linear patterns in certain grade ranges requiring adjustment

## Files
- `grade_analysis.ipynb` - Main analysis notebook
- `data/` - Sample grade datasets
- `models/` - Trained regression models

## What I Learned
Practical application of regression analysis to solve real-world educational data challenges, importance of data cleaning for model accuracy.
